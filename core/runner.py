"""Autonomous job runner: 6, 12 or 24 hour jobs with a target, ticks and checkpoints.

Runs as a background thread inside the Streamlit server process. Jobs are stored in the database, so a restart
resumes any job that has not passed its end time. The server process must stay running for jobs to progress
(run the app on an always-on machine or VPS for 12 and 24 hour jobs).
